# layer-cdk-service-kicker

Installs a background service, cdk-service-kicker, for kicking cdk services.
Sometimes they just need it.

This layer exists entirely as a workaround for
https://github.com/juju-solutions/bundle-canonical-kubernetes/issues/357.
Probably best not to use it for any other purpose.
